# Mathematics and Statistics

When you Google for the math requirements for data science, the three topics that consistently come up are calculus, linear algebra, and statistics. The good news is that — for most data science positions — the only kind of math you need to become intimately familiar with is statistics.

## How will I use Mathematics and Statistics in my ML career
The knowledge of Mathematics and Statistics is important for data practitioner to have. Mathematics and Statisitics has been used to create the ever elegant algorithms (Logistic Regression, Linear Regression etc) that we use to model data and/or make prediction. You will use the knowledge of math and stats to understand the underlying effect an algorithm will have on your data. You'll also use it to answer questions like which algorithm will work for this data, why a certain algorithm performs worse on this data etc.

## Why is it Important to Understand Mathematics and Statistics 
It is very important to understand math and stats because then you will be able to illustrate your findings or estimate. 

## How Mathematics and Statistics helps to solve problem
Esentially, every machine learning model you will develop is an approximation/estimate of the target variable. You're able to build this estimate because of the underlying stats that has been used to build the algorithms.

## Key Topics
1. Calculus: For many people with traumatic experiences of mathematics from high school or college, the thought that they’ll have to re-learn calculus is a real obstacle to becoming a data scientist. In practice, while many elements of data science depend on calculus, you may not need to (re)learn as much as you might expect. For most data scientists, it’s only really important to understand the principles of calculus, and how those principles might affect your models. If you understand that the derivative of a function returns its rate of change, for example, then it’ll make sense that the rate of change trends toward zero as the graph of the function flattens out.

2. Linear Algebra: If you’re doing data science, your computer is going to be using linear algebra to perform many of the required calculations efficiently. If you perform a Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of your data, you’ll be using linear algebra. If you’re working with neural networks, the representation and processing of the network is also going to be performed using linear algebra. In fact, it’s hard to think of many models that aren’t implemented using linear algebra under the hood for the calculations. At the same time, it’s very unlikely that you’re going to be hand writing code to apply transformations to matrices when applying existing models to your particular data set. So, again, understanding of the principles will be important, but you don’t need to be a linear algebra guru to model most problems effectively.

3. Probability and Statisitics: the branches of mathematics concerned with the laws governing random events, including the collection, analysis, interpretation, and display of numerical data [Learn about probability and statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)
4. Discrete Math: is a branch of mathematics involving discrete elements that uses algebra and arithmetic. It is increasingly being applied in the practical fields of mathematics and computer science. It is a very good tool for improving reasoning and problem-solving capabilities.[Learn more here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/discrete_mathematics/discrete_mathematics_introduction.htm)
5. Information Theory: a mathematical representation of the conditions and parameters affecting the transmission and processing of information. [Learn more here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/informationtheory)
