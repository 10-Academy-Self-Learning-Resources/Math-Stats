As explained by Tirthajyoti Sarkar Ph.D. in EE

Data science, by its very nature, is not tied to a particular subject area and may deal with phenomena as diverse as cancer diagnoses and social behavior analysis. This produces the possibility of a dizzying array of n-dimensional mathematical objects, statistical distributions, optimization objective functions, etc.

Mathematics is the bedrock of any contemporary discipline of science. Almost all the techniques of modern data science, including machine learning, have a deep mathematical underpinning. Therefore, a solid understanding of the mathematical machinery behind the cool algorithms will give you an edge among your peers.

The area of math that covers the basics, from the equation of a line to the binomial theorem and everything in between are listed below:
<ul>
  <li>Logarithm, exponential, polynomial functions, rational numbers</li>
  <li>Basic geometry and theorems, trigonometric identities</li>
  <li>Real and complex numbers, basic properties</li>
  <li>Series, sums, inequalities</li>
  <li>Graphing and plotting, Cartesian and polar coordinates, conic sections</li>
 </ul>
